**Removal of excess oligonucleotides from Lambda DNA by PEG
precipitation**

Written by Corentin Moevus, 09/10/15

**Goal:** to separate unligated “handles” and other contaminants &lt;=
100bp from Lambda DNA.

**Principle:** High concentrations of PEG will pull DNA out of solution
in a size-dependent manner. The higher the PEG concentration, the
shorter the precipitated DNA fragments. At 10% PEG8000, only the
fragments larger than \~300bp are pulled out of solution. Below 10% PEG,
precipitation efficiency drops considerably. Below \~0.05 g/L of DNA,
the efficiency of precipitation will also drop. At 0.005 g/L,
precipitation does not happen. The efficiency of precipitation is
increased by cold, incubation time and centrifugation.

**Buffers:**

1.  PEG8000 30% (m/v) + 10mM MgCl~2~

2.  TE150: 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl

**Protocol:**

1.  Make sure your DNA is in a buffer with at least 10mM Mg^2+^. If not,
    bring it to that value. Mg2+ helps with the precipitation of the
    DNA. 1X NEB T4 ligase buffer contains 10mM MgCl~2~. I often bring
    the \[Mg^2+^\] to \~20mM before adding the PEG solution, mostly
    because I can, maybe because it helps the precipitation (but this is
    a anecdotal observation).

2.  Add ½ volume of PEG8000 30% + 10mM MgCl~2~ to your DNA preparation,
    bringing the concentration of PEG8000 to 10%. Incubate for 30mins to
    overnight on ice or at 4°C with rotation. The longer the incubation,
    the cleaner the separation and the more efficient the precipitation.
    Rotation does seem to help (anectodal).

3.  Spin down at 14,000g, 5mins. Remove supernatant. The pellet may be
    invisible (I could observe it at 50mg DNA, though) so be careful. It
    may be worth it to centrifuge at stronger speeds to make the pellet
    more stable, though I never tried it. This may also backfire and
    make the DNA harder to resuspend or brake it.

4.  *Optional:* clean with 70% Ethanol to remove excess PEG, Mg^2+^ and
    co.

5.  Resuspend in TE150 (or your favorite buffer) to get the desired
    final concentration of DNA (the precipitation efficiency is often
    close to 100%, so you can predict the mass of DNA you are
    dissolving).

6.  *Optional:* Test the efficiency of separation/precipitation by
    loading both supernatant and resuspended pellet on an agarose gel.
