**Redding Lab Scope Protocol v1.00**

**Lipids (Rinse) Buffer:**

10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 

100mM NaCl 

**BSA Buffer:**

> *Note: BSA buffer usually is the basis for your experimental buffer,
> so the salt conditions can and usually do vary. The following
> conditions are common. *

40mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/50mL

20mM KCl \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/50mL

1mM MgCl2 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/50mL

0.5mg/mL BSA \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/50mL

1mM DTT \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/50mL

**common imaging Buffer:**

BSA buffer plus the following.

100pM YoYo1 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/mL

1% (w/v) Glucose \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/mL

Gloxy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/mL

100 units/mL glucose oxidas

> 1,560 units/mL catalase

**Step 1: Cleaning**

1.  Clean out out two adapter tubes with \~3mL of 100% ethanol two
    times, followed by two rinses of \~3mL of ddH2O.

2.  Attach adapters to flowcell and rinse twice with ddH2O, once in each
    direction.

3.  Rinse flowcell with lipids buffer.

    a.  ***At the end of this step, all air needs to be removed from the
        flowcell, introduction of air bubbles past this point ruins the
        experiment.***

**Step 2: Making a lipid bilayer**

1.  Briefly vortex lipids prior to pipetting

2.  Add 40uL of lipids to 960uL of lipids buffer and vortex to mix

3.  Inject lipids into flowcell in 3 short injections (\~300uL each)
    waiting 5-10min in between injections.

4.  Rinse with \~2.5mL of lipids buffer and incubate for 30min. This
    step can be extended (1-1.5 hrs total keeping in mind total bilayer
    time)

5.  *Note: These steps can be repeated for a slightly better bilayer.*

**Step 3: (if double tethering, otherwise go to step 4)**

1.  Add 20uL of 1mg/mL anti-dig to 500uL of lipids buffer and vortex to
    mix

2.  Inject anti-dig into flowcell in 2 short injections (\~200uL each)
    waiting at least 15min in between injections. This step can be
    extended (1-1.5 hrs total keeping in mind total bilayer time)

**Step 4: BSA wash/streptavidin**

1.  Wash flowcell with BSA buffer and let sit for at least 5min This
    step can be extended (0.5 hrs total keeping in mind total bilayer
    time).

2.  Mix 15uL 1mg/mL streptavidin with 500uL BSA buffer. ***Do not ever
    vortex BSA bufferâ€¦ Bubbles!***

3.  Inject streptavidin into flowcell in 2 short injections (\~200uL
    each) waiting at least 7min in between injections.

4.  Wash flowcell with \~3mL BSA buffer

**Step 5: DNA**

1.  Check flowcell direction!

2.  Mix appropriate amount of DNA with \~1mL BSA buffer

3.  Inject DNA into flowcell in 3 or more short injections (\~300uL
    each) waiting 5-10min in between injections. **Important: Leave
    back-pressure syringe in place!**

4.  Go do science!
